// About


    // my favourite lethal weapon film is lethal weapon 3, and I am pretty good at making paper planes.  As for actors, I like Bill Paxton because he is the only person to have been killed by a Predator, an Alien, and a Terminator.
   // the first computer I ever programmed was an Acorn Electron, when I was aged about 5, and used to type the games in from a magazine.  i would say things got less exciting than that -> 2nd line support, and then more exciting again,
// gradually larger CMS jobs with more responsibility until lead/sole developer.

// at university I brewed some beer, also I made <colour>l<colour>s<colour>d.


    // The only album really worth taking seriously is "Full English Breakfast" by Shitmat, which you can't really say is seminal, because he has already chosen a different bodily function in his name.


//
// so that's alright then ennit?


// HOW

//  I actually love writing detailed documentation, mainly for two reasons a) I don't forget what I am doing , and can pick it up (b) someone else can pick up what I am doing if I mangle everything up or get hit by a bus,
//  but these things rarely seem to happen, and I am not sure that anyone does actually ever have to read much of my documentation in the end apart from the demonstrably
//  Sometimes I wonder if somebody elses' documentation I have had to read got hit by a mangle, and now that is why I am working on their stuff, and in their style, sometimes in their pants, but I try not to ask too many questions about what happened to former employees of places.
//  When writing documentation, especially if it something like a detailed bug report, I try to not look like my brane has been mangled by a bus

// As for this website, I modelled the octopus from an 8 point pose rig I bought and wrapped the bones around an ankor in blender, and it uses a three.js plugin through a react-three-fiber which is a react <reconciler> which means it lets you use syntax of putting things in <Angle Brackets> basically, which is banging.
// To look around it rotates the neck bone which are connected to the tentacle bones I believe - but don't ask me, I'm no blender doctor.  However in the process of this I am learning I would definitely like to work with blender folks, and used to make skins and mdl files for games like halflife when I was a young un.

// I rate this 11/10 would do this again, alas I am a developer and designing this website has taken me 31 years, so that is probably a mean of how often I can design stuff: implementation, now that is a different matter...

// The code for this site is <a href="https://github.com/chrisjosephs/digibitsy.frontend">on github here</a>.  You can nick it if you like but it's all about me so that would be a bit silly.

//  As a contractor under the flag of Dibigitsymicronanocyberweb since 2017 (Compuglobalhypermeganet was already taken), Christopher Josephs Esq, has been using a very big ferry called FerryMcFerryFace, plying ports on site from as North as Manchester and Liverpool, as West as Dublin, and as South as Brighton and Bournemouth,
//  and even at Cambridge but that was wierd and full of Harry Potter colleges people in pointy hats,
//  and once I accidently ran over a tramp in a graveryard at midnight on my bike.
//  Typically arriving at incredibly short notice and running Ubuntu on deck, which he prefers to Macs generally on which he is happy nonetheless to work if is in the spirt of the crew,
//  even if he is rescuing your project locked into one working mac during an office move with a striking deadline, and only mandated to use that one painfully creaking machine with the inodes bug!), nobody has yet lost an eye or got a pointy thing in their foot.
//  Though a lot of my experience is in Drupal, I am not a one trick Pony,  <a href="https://www.darleyeurope.com/"> I’ve had a whole field of p̶o̶n̶i̶e̶s̶ stallions</a>, waiting to literally run towards this: more recently
//  developing a moodle module.  I used that at school..  Who knew people still use moodle?

// Despite arguably nothing ever happening in real life in IT, once, working for a property auctioneer millions of geese and farmers, possibly with shotguns, although possibly the shotgun are just an artistic embellishment to try and make things sound more exciting,
// but when I was sat in my chair, I definitely felt like they might be toting shotguns under their coats, arrived to try and funk everyone up in a protest, but it wasn't geese it was people protesting vulture funds, but then I am assured
// that they do not want to deal with vulture funds, kind of like how McDonalds no longer do that SuperSize thing or the funny chicken nuggets after than man ate 3 supersize McDonalds every day in a documentary, so actually I can sleep easy
// Once in Liverpool whilst doing a live job that could only be done at the weekend, some racist thugs did a march because they wanted Britain to be back British, which I think was meant to be against people with funny hats, or beards, but all they did was stop
// Christopher Josephs from collecting his Chinese takeaway by getting it cordoned off.  This is the most dangerous this job has ever been, apart from lots of people, possibly agents of Ashgarhd, or Metal Beak, trying to constantly DDOS the BBC but I was too little to know owt about that.
// I did some stuff that got bought up by Acquia!  I think my main point was "your not using long poll"
// Once in Manchester I worked in a place which I think had bats in the roof, also nobody could see, and ministers used to come round, from the actual government, which is how I know that ministers are able to see in the dark now.
// Christopher Josephs is still not sure of the rules of what stuff you are meant to talk about and what stuff you ain't according to which bits you worked on for whom'st, whilst working under whom'st've'deth but this is spelled out in more detail on my cv.
// who knows, maybe it is Impossible (upside down question mark)¿.  But then it was not impossible, and there are people that can confirm that it was not impossible.
// prior to this CJ was gunning for Immediate Media, holding down back end for some legacy code, and asl
//  Currently CJ is scouting out for more contracts, with a personal preference on Drupal, or SPA development with Gatsby and React, or all three as with this site, and would also love to get stuck into more three.js on the front end side,
//  and might even consider settling down if he gets to play with all of these, with a dog called Lionel, but I don't know if you get a dog with your pension policy that you can't access until after you are dead at 75 or what not....  CJ has seen pretty much all the country now, except Newcastle, which I have been told "do not go there", besides which you don't have much time for sight seeing when you are hardcore on a project.
